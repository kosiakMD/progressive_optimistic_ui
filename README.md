# Progressive (optimistic) UI [Example]

Example page: Realization Optimistic UI with Realistic elements by Redux

 - Optimistic 'utility': [here](/src/optimism/index.js)

 - 'Connection' to store: [here](src/store/index.js)

Supports ordinary plain and 'async' Actions (like [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk))

 - Provides real Store if needed

 - Povides immutability - same approach as Redux has
